# stress.ai
This code is for stress inversion according to fracture data obtained from deep boreholes.

Taking scientific borehole Cajon Pass as an example, this MATLAB package includes 4 folders:

1) Initiation--Specifying directories of input and output
2) CajonPass--Including fracture datasets of Cajon Pass and output of stress inversion
3) Main_Inversion--Performing stress inversion in the main function "FracInv.m"
4) Figure_Plot--Providing two ways to plot the inversion results ("Plotting.m" for individual stress parameters; "StereonetPlot.m" for Lower-hemisphere stereographic projections of principal stresses)
